# Symbol-Table
## Project Overview
This project implements a symbol table for a compiler using hash tables, providing robust support for nested scopes. The symbol table allows for efficient insertion and lookup of variables within the current scope, with recursive lookup in parent scopes if necessary.

## Key Features

- **Hash Table Implementation:** Fast and efficient retrieval of symbols.
- **Nested Scope Support:** Manage symbols within nested scopes seamlessly.
- **Recursive Lookup:** Automatically search parent scopes if a symbol is not found in the current scope.
